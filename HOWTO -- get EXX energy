How to get exact exchange (EXX) energy?
=======================================

Our KPM-RPA code provides us the RPA correlation energy E_RPA. 
To get the total energy of the systems, we still need other energy 
components, e.g., Kohn-Sham kinetic energy, Hartree energy, 
exact-exchange (EXX) energy, and external energy. How to get them? 
Here is the reciept which works with ABINIT v8.8.2.


Following is a sample input file for getting these energy terms.

Step 1: perform self-consistent PBE calculation
Step 2: perform non-self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation
