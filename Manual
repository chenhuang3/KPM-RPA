Overview 
========

RPA program runs in three modes so far. The input file is rpa_kpm.ini. The three modes are
1)  eig_min  => compute the lowest eigenvalue of sqrt(vc)\chi_{KS}sqrt(vc)
2)  eig_all  => compute the lowest eigenvalue of sqrt(vc)\chi_{KS}sqrt(vc)
3)  kpm      => perform the KPM sampling
4)  kpm_no_fix_mu0    => perform the KPM sampling with mu0 not fixed
4)  exx      => compute EXX energy 


Description of the scripts
==========================

get_exact_ERPA.py: 
Obtain the N lowest eigenvalues of sqrt(vc)\chi_{KS}sqrt(vc), and compute RPA energy.
   
get_ERPAm.py: 
Get the KPM results from system 1 and system 2 to compute the RPA energy.
